### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suhail11840/gostays-mern.git
cd gostays-mern
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Create an environment file:**
    Duplicate the `.env.example` (if provided) or create a new file named `.env` in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string" # e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/gostays_db or Atlas URI
    PORT=8080 # Or any port you prefer for the backend

    CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:5173" # Default Vite frontend URL

    # Clerk Credentials
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY="your_clerk_secret_key_from_dashboard"
    # CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_clerk_publishable_key" # Not strictly needed backend, but good to have
    CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET="your_clerk_webhook_signing_secret"

    # TomTom API Key
    MAP_TOKEN="your_tomtom_api_key"

    # Server Base URL (for constructing public URLs for uploads)
    SERVER_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080" # Should match your backend's host and port
    ```

4.  **Configure Clerk Webhook (Important for User Sync):**
    *   In your Clerk Dashboard, go to your application settings.
    *   Navigate to "Webhooks".
    *   Click "Add Endpoint".
    *   For the **Endpoint URL**, use `YOUR_BACKEND_URL/api/users/webhook/clerk`.
        *   If running locally and need to expose your backend to the internet for Clerk, use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/): `ngrok http 8080`. Then the URL would be `https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.io/api/users/webhook/clerk`.
    *   For **Message signing secret**, paste the `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` you got from Clerk and put in your `.env`.
    *   Select the events to listen to: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`.
    *   Save the webhook.

5.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # For development with Nodemon (auto-restarts on file changes)
    # or
    # npm start # For production
    ```
    The backend server should now be running (typically on `http://localhost:8080`).

### üñºÔ∏è Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory (from the project root):**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    # or if you are in the root:
    # cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the `frontend` directory and add the following:

    ```env
    VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_clerk_publishable_key_from_dashboard"
    VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080/api" # URL of your backend API
    ```
    *   Ensure `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points to where your backend is running.

4.  **Configure Clerk Frontend:**
    *   In your Clerk Dashboard, ensure your application's "Frontend API Keys" section has the correct domains listed for development (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) and production.

5.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The frontend development server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.

**Note on LaTeX:**
For complex mathematical expressions, you can use LaTeX within Markdown like this:
Inline math: `$E = mc^2$` which renders as $E = mc^2$.
Block math:
`$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n $$`
Which renders as:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n $$
However, for a project like GoStays, this is typically not needed in the README. Well-formatted code blocks (as used above) are standard.
